## Features
- Installs NSP/NSZ/XCI/XCZ files and split NSP/XCI files from your SD card
- Installs NSP/NSZ/XCI/XCZ files over LAN or USB from tools such as [NS-USBloader](https://github.com/developersu/ns-usbloader)
- Installs NSP/NSZ/XCI/XCZ files over the internet by URL or Google Drive
- Verifies NCAs by header signature before they're installed
- Installs and manages the latest signature patches quickly and easily
- Based on [Adubbz Tinfoil](https://github.com/Adubbz/Tinfoil)
- Uses [XorTroll's Plutonium](https://github.com/XorTroll/Plutonium) for a pretty graphical interface
- Just werks

## Why?
Because Goldleaf tends to not "Just werk" when installing NSP files. I wanted a *free software* solution that installs, looks pretty, and doesn't make me rip my hair out whenever I want to put software on my Nintendo Switch. Turtle Installer does exactly that. It installs software. That's about it!

If you want to do other things like manage installed tickets, titles, and user accounts, check out [Goldleaf](https://github.com/XorTroll/Goldleaf)!
